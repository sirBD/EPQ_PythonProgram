"""Game Design = Code a game that allows simple bets to be made on a grid.
Player will get a balance at the start of each round, and scores will be stored in a file.
Game chooses a square on the grid. Player can choose grid size(4x4,6x6,8x8). Higher the score potential for the
larger grids. Seen as difficulties. Once random square is chosen, player will choose their square and both choices
will be revealed. If the player chooses the same square as the game, they get their bet multiplied by the difficulty
(grid size determines this). Potential - able to choose multiple different squares and bet different amounts.
